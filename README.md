Analysis of various machine learning algorithm for stock value prediction
The code calculate the mean sqaure error for different machine learnig algorithm.
Algorithm included are:- 
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. KkNN
4. Decision tree
5. SVM

There are 5 sample datasets available in repository
In code path string needs to be change to file name and then code must be run.
It requires panda, numpy and sklearn to run.
